          We live in a dynamic world. 24hrs in a day are not enough, and the weekend lasts a bit longer than a cup of hot coffee. While chasing our dreams we often forget to take a step back and enjoy the beautiful moments along the way. Savoring the highs is important, but how often do we take time out to enjoy the small victories? Or acknowledge them?

          Like that time when you taught your elderly neighbors how to video call. You were the reason for their smile! Or when your bestie was going through a heartbreak and you helped her move on. Getting your kids to try a new vegetable, finishing that book you started months ago or learning a new dance form. At Zavya, we believe you deserve a pat on your back for all these triumphs too! Celebrating the little achievements between the big milestones is food for your Soul!
